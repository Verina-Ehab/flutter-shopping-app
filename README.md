# Flutter Shopping App Project
Sprints x Microsoft Summer Camp - Mobile Development Final Project

This repository contains the source code for a comprehensive Flutter shopping application. The project was developed as a step-by-step guide to mastering Dart and Flutter, progressing from fundamental concepts to intermediate mobile development techniques.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The application simulates a real-world mobile shopping experience. It features user authentication (Sign Up and Sign In), a dynamic home screen with product displays, cart functionality, and a responsive user interface that works on different screen sizes. The final stage of the project includes localization support for the Arabic language.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Aesthetic Welcome Screen:** A static intro page that directs users to sign up or sign in.
-   **User Authentication:**
    -   Sign-up form with input validation (name, email, password).
    -   Sign-in form for returning users.
-   **Interactive Shopping Home Screen:**
    -   A horizontal `PageView` for featured products.
    -   A responsive `GridView` displaying product cards (2 per row).
    -   An "Add to Cart" icon on each product, with a `SnackBar` confirmation.
    -   A vertically scrollable "Hot Offers" section built with `ListView.builder`.
-   **Smooth Navigation:** Animated fade transitions between the authentication and home screens.
-   **Localization (Bonus):** Full Arabic language support using the `intl` package, with no hardcoded UI strings.
-   **Clean Codebase:** The project follows best practices, including modular widgets, clear naming conventions, and proper file structure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used

-   **Dart:** For core application logic, functions, and OOP.
-   **Flutter SDK:** For building the user interface and all app features.
